@belovachap July 19, 2014. Should we rename COutput to Coin since it's really
                           just representing that idea anyway?
@belovachap July 19, 2014. These modules need to get broken down into smaller,
                           more focused files. Probably start grouping related
                           ideas into folders under src? e.g. src/wallet/*.cpp

@belovachap July 22, 2014. Alright, these files are too big to really work with.
                           I started to pull out CWalletTx into
                           wallet_transaction.cpp/h. Try building the test
                           suite, there are more include things to work out :\
