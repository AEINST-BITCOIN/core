@belovachap July 19, 2014. Should we rename COutput to Coin since it's really
                           just representing that idea anyway?
@belovachap July 19, 2014. These modules need to get broken down into smaller,
                           more focused files. Probably start grouping related
                           ideas into folders under src? e.g. src/wallet/*.cpp
